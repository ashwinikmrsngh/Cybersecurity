**We will consider a scenario involving a customer of the company that I work for who experiences a security issue when accessing the company’s website. I will  identify the likely cause of the service interruption. Then, I will explain how the attack occurred and the negative impact it had on the website.**


<h2>Scenario</h2>


<p>I work as a security analyst for a travel agency that advertises sales and promotions on the company’s website. The employees of the company regularly access the
  company’s sales webpage to search for vacation packages that their customers might like. One afternoon, I receive an automated alert from your monitoring system
  indicating a problem with the web server. I attempt to visit the company’s website, but I receive a connection timeout error message in my browser. I use a packet
  sniffer to capture data packets in transit to and from the web server. I notice a large number of TCP SYN requests coming from an unfamiliar IP address. The web
  server appears to be overwhelmed by the volume of incoming traffic and is losing its ability to respond to the abnormally large number of SYN requests. I suspect
  the server is under attack by a malicious actor. I take the server offline temporarily so that the machine can recover and return to a normal operating status. I
  also configure the company’s firewall to block the IP address that was sending the abnormal number of SYN requests. I know that your IP blocking solution won’t last
  long, as an attacker can spoof other IP addresses to get around this block. I need to alert my manager about this problem quickly and discuss the next steps to stop
  this attacker and prevent this problem from happening again. I will need to be prepared to tell my boss about the type of attack I discovered and how it was
  affecting the web server and the employees of the company.</p>
